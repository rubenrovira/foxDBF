## [0.9.0] - 2026-07-05

### Changed

- BREAKING: `PACK` and `ZAP` now require writers opened or created with `LockMode.Exclusive`.
  Calling either command through the default/shared writer now fails before touching the file with
  typed VFP error `110` ("File must be opened exclusively.").
- BREAKING: microVFP's maximum procedure/function call depth was tightened from `64` to `48`. Code
  that relied on deeper recursion now hits the existing maximum-call-depth error earlier.
